# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 5
# puts 2

# puts 5 + 2
# puts 5 * 2
# puts 5 - 2
# puts 5 / 2.0
# puts (5 - 2) * 3

# Non-numbers
# puts "Hello, world!"
# puts "Tacos are" + " delish"
# puts "tacos" * 3
# puts "tacos" + 3
# puts 3 * "tacos"

# True, False
# puts true
# puts false 
puts 3 == 2

# Nothing

# Variables
zebra = 5
giraffe = 2

puts zebra + giraffe

food = "tacos"
quantity = 3

puts food * quantity

# Combine strings and variables
puts "I want #{quantity} #{food}"

name = "Olivia"
puts "Hello, #{name}!"

# String manipulation
